# Network-Application-Protocol

## Introduction

This application is a simple, lightweight chat program that demonstrates the basics of network communication using Python's socket programming. It consists of two parts: a client application and a server application. The client sends messages to the server, which then echoes the messages back to the client. The application also implements a basic handshake mechanism to ensure a reliable connection setup.

## Features

* TCP/IP socket programming: Utilizes Python's socket library for network communication.
* Basic handshaking protocol: Ensures reliable initiation of the communication session.
